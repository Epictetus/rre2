RRE2 - Ruby RE2 binding
-----------------------

Today (16/03/2010) Google released its regular expression library RE2 to
the public under a BSD license. It is written in C++ and is available at
http://code.google.com/p/re2/.

This library is a Ruby binding to it and aiming to be compatible with the
built in Ruby Regexp class, however only the very basics are implemented.
The implementation was heavily influenced by pyre2
(http://github.com/facebook/pyre2).

NOTE: This is a very early stage code of bad quality and is just an
experiment of how this can be done. It happens to work with the supplied
test.rb on one computer. It is not supposed to be used for any productive
work.

To compile either install the gem, or run the following:
ruby extconf.rb
make

It expects that the RE2 library is installed and is available on the path.
